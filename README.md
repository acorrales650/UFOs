# UFO Sightings

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage using javascript, html, and css that is capable of filtering a data set in a clean, inviting, and concise manner. The filter put on the webpage is able to narrow the data set by date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results
The webpage is successful in completed its intended purposes. Scrolling down the page, the filter is located on the left side of the page. Once located, the user can filter the criteria they would like to see.

- For example, below is a screenshot of the webpage filtered by the date of 1/13/2010. Note that only results with the date of 1/13/2010 are now showing.

After the user is finished reviewing that filtered data, they can scroll back to the top and use the 'UFO Sightings' tag on the top left corner to refresh the data set. 



- Below is another example of the filtering the data set, but this time by the shape. Here, the example shows the filter 'fireball' has been activated and only results with 'fireball' as the shape are avaialble.

- One last example to show the ability of the webpage. An exciting thing that is available is filtering more than one criteria. Below, the data is filtered again to the shape of 'fireball', but from there another filtered of 'ca' for the state has been added. Notice how the data is only showing the intended results of 'fireball' shape and 'ca' for state.

## Analysis
While the webpage is capable of great filtering, the one drawback that became noticable while testing was the ability to filter within the filters. For example the user would be unable to filter multiple states at a time or more than one city. To fix this, the addition of a drop down menu and selection option within each filter could be useful along with another possible filter of duration. These two recommendations could prove beneficial for further development of the webpage and its functionality.
